# PROVIDERS

- So sometimes we need to useless specific provider like 6.7 .3 or 7.3
- So if you want to use a specific provider we'll mention that provider and the thing is like but when we again provide provider with new value or new version it will throw an error
- Every time when you create a provider or when you give any version then it will check with the lock file
- So if you want to overwrite that log file then we need to use this command
- ```
  terraform init --upgrade
  ```
